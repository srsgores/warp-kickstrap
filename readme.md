## Features
* CSS3 cutomizable icons using Icomoon, with IE6+ fallback.  Already enabled, with starter icons.  Using Icomoon, you can even import your own icons from Illustrator in ``.svg``
* Blank, easy-to-use stylesheet, with LESS mixins to get you started.  Mixins are adapted from Bootstrap, and will work for all browsers.  Prefix free because of LESS!
* LESS server-side compilation.  The server will check for changes in the ``style.less`` file and compile as needed
* Customizable grid system.  The user can select how many columns he/she wants in the design.  12 is the default.  Names can change too, so if there's a site with Bootstrap markup, all the user needs to do is change it!  All styles change with it too!
* Versatile design.  All colours are relative to three selected colours in the admin backend.  From there, the LESS is so well-designed that using its colour functions, the whole site can work *relatively* to those three colours.  Simply put, by changing the three colours, everything in your site can change.
* IE6-friendly.  The user can select to load ``modernizr`` (via cdn or locally), and there's built-in support for CSS3 using **CSS3 PIE**.  This can be enabled/disabled in the back-end.
* Scalable proportions.  Using the multiplier idea, you can set your multiplier to scale your design up or down as needed.  All proportions are based off of the multiplier, so you can make your site look just the way you want.

# Theme Development
The biggest advantage to using this framework is that once you develop one theme, you have it developed for both Joomla and Wordpress.  This allows your templates to reach a larger audience, so it's great for this sort of thing.
