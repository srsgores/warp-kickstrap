Warp Kickstrap CMS Framework
==============================
Open-source html5 flexible css3 template boilerplate for web developers of Joomla and Wordpress*

Warp Kickstrap is a PHP framework for CMS (content management systems) that works with Joomla and Wordpress.  It offers a great starting point for developers, and it is based off of the Kickstrap repository hosted here on Github.  It sits below the CMS, allowing it to work with both Wordpress and Joomla.  This means your templates can reach more audiences.

Warp Kickstrap is also the second true theming system for Joomla that offers support for server-side LESS compilation.

Best of all, you give your users the ultimate flexibility: choose from any of the popular javascript libraries including Modernizr, Chosen, Noty, Masonry, and even load LESS files.
